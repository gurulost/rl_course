## 2.1 Model-Based vs. Model-Free Approaches\n\nReinforcement Learning algorithms can be broadly categorized based on whether the agent uses or learns a **model** of the environment.\n\nA **model** in RL refers to the agent\'s representation of how the environment works. Specifically, it predicts:\n\n1.  **State Transitions:** Given a state `s` and an action `a`, what is the probability of ending up in the next state `s\'`? (Often denoted as \( P(s\' | s, a) \))\n2.  **Rewards:** Given a state `s` and an action `a` (and possibly the next state `s\'`), what is the expected reward `r`? (Often denoted as \( R(s, a) \) or \( R(s, a, s\') \))\n\nUnderstanding whether an agent uses a model is crucial as it determines the learning strategy and the algorithm\'s characteristics.\n\n### Model-Based RL\n\n*   **Concept:** In model-based RL, the agent explicitly learns or is given a model of the environment. It uses this model to **plan** future actions by simulating potential sequences of states, actions, and rewards.\n*   **How it Works:**\n    1.  Learn the transition probabilities \( P(s\' | s, a) \) and reward function \( R(s, a) \) from experience.\n    2.  Use the learned model for planning. This often involves techniques from dynamic programming (like Value Iteration or Policy Iteration) or tree search methods to find an optimal policy or value function.\n    3.  Execute actions based on the plan.\n*   **Analogy:** Like using a map and GPS (the model) to plan the best route before starting a journey.\n*   **Examples:** Dyna-Q, Prioritized Sweeping, algorithms using techniques like Value Iteration or Policy Iteration on a learned model.\n*   **Advantages:**\n    *   **Sample Efficiency:** Can be more data-efficient, especially if the model is accurate. It can simulate many trajectories internally without costly real-world interactions.\n    *   **Planning:** Allows for explicit planning and reasoning about future outcomes.\n    *   **Transferability (Potentially):** A learned model might be adaptable if the environment changes slightly.\n*   **Disadvantages:**\n    *   **Model Accuracy:** Performance heavily depends on the accuracy of the learned model. Model errors can compound and lead to suboptimal policies.\n    *   **Computational Cost:** Learning the model and planning can be computationally expensive, especially in complex environments.\n    *   **Design Complexity:** Requires designing both the model learning part and the planning part.\n\n### Model-Free RL\n\n*   **Concept:** In model-free RL, the agent learns a policy or value function directly from experience (states, actions, rewards) without explicitly constructing a model of the environment\'s dynamics.\n*   **How it Works:** The agent learns by trial and error, associating states or state-action pairs directly with values or optimal actions.\n    *   **Value-Based:** Learn a value function (e.g., Q-values) that estimates the expected return for taking actions in states (e.g., Q-learning, SARSA, DQN).\n    *   **Policy-Based:** Learn a policy directly, mapping states to actions or action probabilities (e.g., REINFORCE, Policy Gradient Methods).\n    *   **Actor-Critic:** Combine value-based and policy-based approaches, using a value function (critic) to help improve the policy (actor).\n*   **Analogy:** Like learning to navigate a city purely by wandering around, remembering which turns led to good or bad outcomes, without ever consulting or drawing a map.\n*   **Examples:** Q-learning, SARSA, DQN, REINFORCE, A3C, PPO.\n*   **Advantages:**\n    *   **Simplicity:** Often simpler to implement as they bypass the model learning step.\n    *   **Directness:** Learns the target policy or value function directly from interaction.\n    *   **Less Prone to Model Error:** Performance is not directly limited by the accuracy of an intermediate model.\n*   **Disadvantages:**\n    *   **Sample Inefficiency:** Typically require significantly more interaction with the environment (more samples/episodes) to learn effectively compared to model-based methods.\n    *   **No Explicit Planning:** Cannot easily \"look ahead\" or simulate consequences without interacting with the real environment.\n\n### Trade-offs and When to Use Each\n\n| Feature             | Model-Based                      | Model-Free                       |\n|---------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| **Sample Efficiency** | Generally Higher                 | Generally Lower                  |\n| **Computational Cost**| Can be High (Model + Planning) | Can be High (Many Interactions) |\n| **Implementation**  | More Complex                     | Often Simpler                    |\n| **Planning Ability**| Yes                              | No (Implicit via learned values) |\n| **Dependence on Model**| High                             | Low / None                       |\n\n*   **Use Model-Based when:**\n    *   Environment interactions are expensive or slow (e.g., robotics, real-world experiments).\n    *   A reasonably accurate model of the environment can be learned or is available.\n    *   Explicit planning or lookahead is beneficial.\n*   **Use Model-Free when:**\n    *   Simulating the environment is cheap and fast (e.g., games, simulations).\n    *   The environment dynamics are too complex to model accurately.\n    *   Implementation simplicity is desired.\n\nThere are also hybrid approaches (like Dyna-Q) that combine elements of both, aiming to get the best of both worlds. The choice between model-based and model-free RL depends heavily on the specific problem, the environment\'s characteristics, and the available computational resources.
