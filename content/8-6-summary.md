## 8.6 Module Summary: Q-Learning Project (CartPole)

This module provided a hands-on application of Q-learning by implementing an agent to solve the classic CartPole balancing task using Gymnasium.

**Key Steps and Concepts Covered:**

1.  **Environment Setup (`8.2`):** We established a dedicated Python virtual environment and installed necessary libraries: `gymnasium` (for the CartPole environment), `numpy` (for numerical operations and the Q-table), and optionally `matplotlib` (for visualizing results).
2.  **State Discretization (`8.3`):** Since Q-learning requires a discrete state space, we converted the continuous state variables (cart position, cart velocity, pole angle, pole angular velocity) from the CartPole environment into discrete bins. We discussed how the choice of bin numbers and bounds can impact performance.
3.  **Q-Table Implementation (`8.3`):** We initialized a Q-table using NumPy, sized according to the number of discrete state bins and the number of possible actions (left/right). The table stores the expected future rewards for taking an action in a given state.
4.  **Q-Learning Algorithm (`8.3`):** We implemented the core Q-learning update rule within an episodic training loop:
    *   The agent interacts with the environment using an **epsilon-greedy strategy** for exploration vs. exploitation.
    *   For each step, the Q-value for the experienced state-action pair is updated based on the received reward and the maximum estimated Q-value of the next state (Temporal Difference learning).
    *   The exploration rate (`epsilon`) was decayed over time to favour exploitation as the agent learned.
5.  **Running and Analysis (`8.4`):** We discussed how to execute the Python script, interpret the training progress (e.g., Q-table shape, periodic reward updates), and analyze the resulting reward plot (raw rewards vs. moving average) to assess learning success, speed, and stability.
6.  **Observing the Agent (`8.4`):** Instructions were provided on how to modify the code to render the environment and watch the trained agent perform, using the learned Q-table to select actions greedily.
7.  **Improvements and Next Steps (`8.5`):** We explored potential improvements like hyperparameter tuning, refining state discretization, and saving/loading the Q-table. We also looked ahead to more advanced RL techniques like Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Policy Gradient methods, which are necessary for tackling problems with larger or continuous state spaces.

**Outcome:**

By the end of this module, you should have a working Q-learning agent capable of learning to balance the CartPole, along with an understanding of the implementation details, how to analyze its performance, and directions for further exploration in Reinforcement Learning.
